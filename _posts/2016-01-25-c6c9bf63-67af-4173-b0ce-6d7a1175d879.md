This post is should probably be an introduction to this page, what it is about, and what to expect. Instead, however, I'm distracted by my observations from today. Today I observed, gentlemen in tailored suits, cashmere scarves and fine leather shoes. Women that knew how to wear makeup and wore it well.

I saw people that cared about their appearance, and took pride in how they presented themselves, as if their dress and styling was a representation of who they were, how they felt and how they wanted to be treated. They carried with them an aura of confidence without projecting arrogance.

They were respectful, treated others with kindness, and in general were patient with one another. Perhaps they were in a hurry, like everyone else in the world today, but they did not show it, and even if they had a perceived schedule of urgency they did not show it in how they interacted with those they contacted.
